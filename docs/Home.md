# Custom Regions Visualization Installation and Configuration

## Requirements
You need:

* A server runningZoomdata 2.3.5 (may work with later versions, at least minor 2.3.x releases)
* An account in Zoomdata with membership in the Administrators group, so you can access data source configuration and chart Studio
* The custom_regions.zip file, which contains the custom chart export from Zoomdata
* Download this repository to your local workstation
* To customize the visualization you need one or more GeoJSON files with your spatial data _(at this time TopoJSON is not supported)_.  Each shape must have a property containing some name or other identifier

**Note, the visualization supports GeoJSON with polygons (regions), points, and lines.  All features in a single GeoJSON source must have the same geometry type (don't mix points and polygons, etc)**
* A data source that has an attribute containing the same names as the property in the GeoJSON; the data source should already be configured in Zoomdata
* Enough understanding of Javascript to be able to edit the code as described in this document; some knowledge of how to debug Javascript in the browser console

## Installation

* Log in to Zoomdata as a user with administrator rights

### Import the Custom Visualization
* Open Chart Studio
* Scroll down to the "Import Chart" section at the very bottom of the page

![Import Chart](images/import_option.png)

* Click "Browse" and navigate to the custom_regions.zip files
* Give your chart a meaningful name, this will be displayed when users are selecting the chart
* Click 'Submit'.  The chart should appear in the list of custom visualizations on the page

### Configure the Data Source
The custom visualization in this repository is configured with a set of test polygons at 3 zoom levels.  The associated data file is in the /sample_data folder of this project.  To get the chart to work out of the box, first add this data set to Zoomdata.

* Open the data source configuration page
* Click on the "Flat File" icon in the "Add a New Data Source" section
* For "Source Name" enter "Custom Regions Sample Data" and click "Next"
* Click the "Add File" button and brows to "test_data.csv" in this repository.  The page will display the fields and first few rows from the file
* For the columns "Region Name 1" and "Region Name 2" change the type from "integer" to "attribute"
* Click "Next", then "Next" again on the field configuration page
* On the Charts configuration page click the "Custom" tab on the left panel and select the custom visualization added previously
* In the chart configuration set the default fields.  In particular, configure the color palette/range you want to use (other values will be overridden in later configuration)
* Click 'Finish'

### Customize the Custom Regions Custom Visualization!

The polygons used in this example are useless for actual work - they don't relate to any real-world data, but do provide a good example of how the visualization works and helps you verify that the installation is correct.

The next step shows you how to customize the map to use a different set of polygons.  Continue with [those instructions](./customizing_the_map.md)


# Advanced Configurations
Once you have the map working with a data source and the appropriate polygons there are other ways you can use the visualization.

## Multiple Custom Region Visualizations

You can have multiple custom regions charts, each with a different set of regions or data source configurations.  Repeat the installation/import and customization process to tailor a new chart to a different set of parameters.  

## Different Data Sources
One custom_regions chart that is loaded can be used against multiple data sources in Zoomdata, provided those data sources have the same field configuration for the region ID.  For example, one table contains sales_value while a different table tracks site_visits; both tables have a field named 'sales_region' with the same set of region names.  Both of these sources can have the newly added visualization associated with them.

## Different Regions

Repeat the import process to create a new custom visualization and perform the full customization for the map.  You will need to import the new GeoJSON files.

## Other versions of Zoomdata

This chart _should_ be compatible with Zoomdata version 2.2.x.  However, the custom visualization import process checks version numbers and does not allow the chart to be imported.  It is possible to create the custom visualization manually by following [these instructions](./manual_vis_creation.md).
